ICS Command Assistant: Mobile App Phase 5 Design Plan

🧩 Phase 5 Overview

Phase 5 focuses on unifying field and command operations with form workflows, reporting tools, and intelligent automation. This phase expands the mobile app’s ability to handle documentation, feedback loops, and dynamic decision support.

📅 Phase 5 Feature Scope

1. Fillable ICS Forms (Mobile)

Field users can access and fill out mobile-friendly ICS forms (e.g., ICS 214, 213)

Forms are tied to user, team, and incident context

Auto-fill key metadata (date, time, team, user)

Submit to backend for inclusion in incident package

2. Dynamic Form Library (Form Engine Integration)

Load custom or agency-provided forms uploaded to backend (Module 11)

Field users can view and fill any assigned or public forms

Submit responses synced to structured backend records

3. After-Action Report (AAR) Submission

At incident end, users can provide structured feedback

Fielded form includes prompts for:

Communication

Safety issues

Recommendations

Submitted responses aid post-incident reviews

4. Incident Notifications & Broadcast Alerts

Push priority notifications from command

Support emergency broadcasts (e.g., evacuate, radio silence)

Audible/vibration alert on field device

5. Field Resources Reference Viewer

Mobile reference library viewer (linked to Module 10)

Field users can access PDFs, SOPs, training guides, maps

Downloadable and cacheable for offline use
