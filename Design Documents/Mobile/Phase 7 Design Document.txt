ICS Command Assistant: Mobile App Phase 7 Design Plan

🌐 Phase 7 Overview

Phase 7 enables real-time inter-agency collaboration, focusing on operational coordination between multiple jurisdictions, mutual aid teams, and external partners. It introduces shared incident channels, joint visibility tools, and permissions that respect agency boundaries.

📅 Phase 7 Feature Scope

1. Multi-Agency Incident Support

Enable a single incident to include users from multiple distinct organizations

Users retain their home agency affiliation but are assigned to unified incident teams

Support different roles/permissions per agency per incident

2. Shared Ops Channel (Interagency Feed)

Command staff can view a feed of:

Status updates

Field logs

Location pings (if permitted)

Feed can be filtered by agency/team/tasking

Includes agency badge/branding per entry

3. Secure Cross-Agency Messaging

Chat channels scoped to:

All agencies

Specific agency-to-agency

Incident-wide

Encrypted transport

Visibility controlled via roles and agency rules

4. Joint Resource Visibility

View combined personnel, tasking, and assets across participating orgs

Visual indicator of agency origin

Filter resources by affiliation, team, and assignment

5. Agency Role Mapping Tool

Admin UI to map roles across orgs:

“Rescue Tech (Org A)” = “Field User (Unified)”

“Comms Officer (Org B)” = “Comms Lead (Unified)”

Supports consistent access control in mixed incidents
