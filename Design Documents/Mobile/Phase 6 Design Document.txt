ICS Command Assistant: Mobile App Phase 6 Design Plan

🔮 Phase 6 Overview

Phase 6 focuses on analytics, oversight, and inter-agency collaboration. It brings real-time dashboards, role auditing, export tools, and the beginnings of interoperability with external systems (e.g., EOC platforms, CAD, radio gateways).

📅 Phase 6 Feature Scope

1. Incident Analytics Dashboard (Command Only)

Real-time overview of incident status

Charts for:

Active personnel by role/team

Tasking progress (e.g., dispatched vs. completed)

Resource utilization

Safety event count

Auto-refresh, filters for incident/time/team

2. Audit Log & Session Tracking

Every user action logged with timestamp and context

Admins can review login activity, check-in/out, form submissions, message sends

Integrated into backend security model

3. Export & Archive Tools (Mobile & Command)

Generate full incident export including:

ICS forms

Status logs

Messages

Location history

Download as ZIP or submit to archive repository

4. Interoperability API Layer (Preview)

Early interface for integrating with external platforms

RESTful JSON export of selected records (tasking, forms, locations)

Authenticated endpoint for CAD/EOC systems

5. Admin Tools for Role & Access Management

UI to manage:

Roles

Incident-specific permissions

Auto-assignment rules (e.g., team joins default to Field User)

Syncs with backend UserRoles logic
