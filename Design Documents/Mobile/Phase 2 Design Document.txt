ICS Command Assistant: Mobile App Phase 2 Design Plan

🔄 Phase 2 Overview

Phase 2 of the mobile app extends core field capabilities and introduces command-side awareness tools. It builds on the MVP and lays the foundation for real-time team coordination.

📅 Phase 2 Feature Scope

1. Tasking & Response System (ICS 204 Inspired by Active911)

Field users receive dynamic taskings pushed from command

Task includes:

Location (with optional map pin)

Objective/summary

Priority

Start/end time

Assigned team

Optional attachments (photo, map, reference)

Users can:

Acknowledge receipt

Mark when en route, on scene, completed

Add notes to the task record

Task screen modeled after Active911 style: rapid read-in, minimal taps

2. Comms Plan Viewer (ICS 205 Integration)

Display radio channel assignments by function

Pull from backend database linked to ICS 205 form
