# Incident Management Assistant

Incident Management Assistant ("SARApp") is a desktop-first toolkit for emergency operations centers. The application combines a PySide6/Qt Quick user interface with an offline-friendly SQLite data layer so that planning, logistics, communications and public information teams can coordinate even when connectivity is limited.

## Key capabilities

- **Dockable PySide6 workspace.** `main.py` boots a Qt `QMainWindow` with Qt Advanced Docking System (ADS) so panels from each section (Command, Planning, Operations, Logistics, Intel, etc.) can be opened, rearranged and saved as perspectives.
- **Offline-first data storage.** Utilities in `utils.db` and `utils.incident_context` manage a shared `data/master.db` file plus per-incident databases under `data/incidents/<id>.db`, with the `CHECKIN_DATA_DIR` environment variable allowing tests or deployments to override the storage root.
- **Logistics check-in workflows.** The logistics check-in module exposes repository and API helpers for copying master records into an active incident, running fuzzy searches and updating statuses so ICS-211 style intake can run offline.
- **Operations and team management.** Operations repositories normalize task and team data, derive status labels, and back the team dashboard and detail panels with reusable dataclasses and query helpers.
- **Forms & PDF generation.** `modules/forms` provides schema-backed templates, rendering helpers and export utilities for ICS forms (e.g., ICS-205) with validation and PDF output used throughout the planning toolchain.
- **Notifications and automation.** The notifier service persists mission notifications, emits toast/badge signals, and wires in a rules engine, scheduler and optional audible alerts for cross-module awareness.
- **Profile-driven customization.** Profiles combine manifests, templates and computed bindings so deployments can tailor branding, catalogs and workflows without touching core code; the profile manager handles discovery, inheritance and runtime switching.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `main.py` | Application entry point, menu wiring and dock manager bootstrap. |
| `main.qml` | Legacy Qt Quick prototype window kept for design reference. |
| `modules/` | Feature modules covering ICS sections (operations, logistics, communications, public info, safety, medical, etc.). |
| `notifications/` | Toast, banner and scheduled alert services plus QML panels. |
| `profiles/` | Deployable configuration profiles with manifests, templates and assets. |
| `data/` | SQLite master/incident databases, templates, catalog exports and sample content. |
| `settings/` | QML settings panels and persisted docking perspectives (`ads_perspectives.ini`). |
| `tests/` | Pytest suite for repositories, APIs, state helpers and accessibility checks. |
| `scripts/` | Utility scripts for inspecting/seedings databases and debugging audits. |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (PySide6 wheels are available for the supported interpreter versions).
- A virtual environment manager such as `venv` or `conda`.

### Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the desktop app

```bash
python main.py
```

The first run creates `data/master.db` plus any incident databases referenced by utilities. Set `CHECKIN_DATA_DIR=/custom/path` before launching to store data outside the repository (useful for tests or production deployments).

### Running a FastAPI module

Several modules (e.g., Public Information) expose REST APIs backed by the same data layer. Activate the virtual environment, ensure an incident database exists, then launch the module:

```bash
python -m modules.public_info.seed  # optional: loads sample content
uvicorn modules.public_info.api:app --reload
```

The API is mounted at `/api/public_info` and supports draft, approval and publishing flows for PIO teams.

## Working with data

- **Master vs incident scope.** `utils.context.master_db()` returns the persistent staff/equipment catalog, while `utils.context.require_incident_db()` opens the active incident database (set via `AppState.set_active_incident`).
- **Seeding objectives.** `scripts/seed_objectives.py` seeds example incident objectives if the table is empty, and `scripts/inspect_db.py` prints a summary of an incident database schema.
- **Forms and templates.** Legacy templates live under `data/templates`, while profile-scoped templates live under `profiles/<id>/templates`. Use `modules/forms.FormRegistry` and `FormSession` for profile-aware export pipelines.

## Developer workflow

1. Activate an incident for development with `AppState.set_active_incident("demo")` or via the UI. This ensures operations repositories, notifications and check-in services point at `data/incidents/demo.db`.
2. Seed or import sample data as needed (`data/examples`, module-specific seed scripts, or manual imports via SQLite tools).
3. Launch the Qt app (`python main.py`) to develop QDock-based panels, or run module entry points (for FastAPI services or CLI utilities).
4. Persisted ADS layouts live in `settings/ads_perspectives.ini`; delete this file or set `FORCE_DEFAULT_LAYOUT = True` in `main.py` for troubleshooting the dock layout.

## Testing

The repository uses `pytest` with lightweight fixtures that redirect database paths via `CHECKIN_DATA_DIR`. Run the full suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

Targeted tests include check-in workflows, catalog repositories, AppState signals and accessibility checks for UI components.

## Additional resources

- **Module READMEs.** Many feature areas include their own README (e.g., `modules/logistics/checkin/README.md`, `modules/public_info/README.md`) that describe domain-specific workflows and APIs.
- **Design documents.** The `Design Documents/` directory contains the original scoping decks, wireframes and data dictionaries that informed the module layout.
- **Notifications UI.** QML panels in `notifications/qml` surface toast history, rules management and scheduler controls powered by the notifier service.

Contributions are welcomeâ€”please open an issue describing proposed changes so the project maintainers can align implementation details with the broader incident management roadmap.
