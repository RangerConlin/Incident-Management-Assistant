"""Logistics dashboard home panel with quick access actions.

This panel is intentionally lightweight but demonstrates how a real
implementation would embed a QML component providing buttons for common
logistics tasks.  The panel is safe to import when Qt is not available; in
such scenarios a simple placeholder widget is returned.
